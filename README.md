# Research
This is where we document our learning.

Please create a markdown file with your research in named using kebab-case. Place it in the appropriate week-X folder (e.g. week-1) and then link to it from this README file.

Any extra resources you find and think would be useful to your cohort add to the extra resources section with links to appropriate websites or markdown files.

## Recommended tutorials

### [Javascript 30 :heart:](https://javascript30.com/)
Build 30 things in 30 days with 30 tutorials. Really great series of small projects. The only issue is that they are all written with newer ES6 syntax.

### [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming ðŸ¤“](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
**Definitely just the first three chapters for now!**

Absolutely amazing book that I would _highly_ recommend coming back to for the final chapters at a later date. For now though, stick to the early stuff! 

### [First class functions :one:](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/ws-software-design-js/tree/master/stage-1/first-class-functions)
If you're struggling with callbacks I would recommend going over this text again from one of the week 3 workshops. Understanding the difference between a function being called (`func()`) and a function being defined/declared (`function func(){}`) will help you to understand how callbacks call back to an old function.

### [Elequent Javascript :pencil:](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
**Again, it gets complex after the first few chapters so maybe move on to something else once you've covered them.**

### [Douglas Crockford - JS the Good Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook)
